/* SCARA CALIBRATION 

SINGLE SCARA
1. Calibrate forearm length & steps per unit using 3 points marked on a paper (Make sure your paper stick to bed & mark exactly from you nozzle)
	a. Home using G28 command
	b. Rotate forearm to the maximum angle as possible on bed use G5 Y___ command. Mark on paper point A and enter G50 P1 command
	c. Rotate forearm to approximately on bed center use G5 Y___ command. Mark on paper point B and enter G50 P2 command
	d. Rotate forearm to the minimum angle as possible on bed use G5 Y___ command. Mark on paper point C and enter G50 P3 command
	e. Measure distance point A to B (X), point B to C (Y), point A to C (Z)
	f. Enter G50 X___ Y___ Z___ S1 command.
	g. Read the calculated forearm length and steps per unit. if it doesn't make sense, repeat the steps. if it make sense enter G50 S11 command to save.
	h. Repeat step 1b & 1c, measure distance point A to B. Enter G50 P5 command, check if the value and measured distance are the same.
	i. If you cannot tolerate with the difference, repeat the calibration or you can manually edit from EEPROM. (suggestion 0.0x tolerance)
2. Calibrate arm steps per unit using 6 points marked on a paper
	a. Home using G28 command
	b. Rotate arm to the maximum angle as possible on bed use G5 X___ command. Mark on paper point A and enter G50 P1 command
	c. Rotate arm to approximately on bed center use G5 X___ command. Mark on paper point B and enter G50 P2 command
	d. Rotate arm to the minimum angle as possible on bed use G5 X___ command. Mark on paper point C and enter G50 P3 command
	e. Measure distance point A to B (X), point B to C (Y), point A to C (Z)
	f. Enter G50 X___ Y___ Z___ S21 command.
	g. Rotate forearm away from arm use G5 Y___ command to get another 3 points different from the first 3. 
	h. Rotate arm to the maximum angle as possible on bed use G5 X___ command. Mark on paper point A and enter G50 P1 command
	i. Rotate arm to approximately on bed center use G5 X___ command. Mark on paper point B and enter G50 P2 command
	j. Rotate arm to the minimum angle as possible on bed use G5 X___ command. Mark on paper point C and enter G50 P3 command
	k. Measure distance point A to B (X), point B to C (Y), point A to C (Z)
	l. Enter G50 X___ Y___ Z___ S22 command.
	m. Compare steps per unit result from step 2f and 2l. It suppose to be the same. Repeat the steps if you are not satisfy.
3. Calibrate arm length and elbow angle.
	a. Enter G50 S23, you will get 2 options for your arm length and elbow angle. choose the one you think right.
	b. Enter G50 S231 if you choose the 1st option, enter G232 if you choose the 2nd option to save you calibration.
	c. If you did it all right, your calibration is done.
